# SmartTextEval 🎓📝  
An Intelligent Writing Evaluation Interface

SmartTextEval is a Django-based web platform that provides **automated writing evaluation** for students. It combines **real-time grammar and spelling correction** with **behavioral analysis** through typing activity tracking. It includes **separate dashboards for students and teachers**, and supports **exercise creation**, **session tracking**, and **pedagogical feedback**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Enable real-time **spelling and grammar correction** (in French)
- Track **typing behavior** (keylogging for pedagogical purposes)
- Provide **role-based dashboards** for students and teachers
- Offer **feedback and scores** based on writing quality
- Allow **teachers to create custom exercises** and follow student progression

## 🧠 Writing Behavior Analysis & JSON Export

You can view the full history of typing events and saved texts from students at:

👉 [http://127.0.0.1:8000/text-analysis/events/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/text-analysis/events/)

This page allows you to:
- 🔁 **Replay the writing process**, including cursor movements and keystrokes
- 📦 **Download the full dataset in JSON format** for further analysis or research
